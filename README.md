## About the project

This web application is the frontend of a future project. The chat application is designed using an MVC design pattern and a glass UI design.

## Technologies

- JavaScript: A high-level programming language.
- React: An open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
- CSS: A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.

- TypeScript: A strict syntactical superset of JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the application simply enter a nickname for the new user and click on "Create room" to create a new room. You will automatically be forwarded to the chatroom.

## Roadmap

The page is only a frontend app. In the future the app will also have a backend to make it possible to chat with other people online. The main object of this project is to use new technologies such as TypeScript and Docker.

The backend will be build using Java and Docker.
